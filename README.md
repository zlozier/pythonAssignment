# BCB 546X Python Assignment

## Assignment Description
This assignment was an exercise in data manipulation, analysis, and graphing using python. The files `penguins_mass.csv`, `sequence_translate.py`, and `penguins_cytb.fasta` were provided. All work done by me was completed in the `Zach Lozier Python Assignment.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.

## Jupyter Notebook file (`Zach Lozier Python Assignment.ipynb`)
Briefly, I more thoroughly documented the `sequence_translate.py` script that was provided to me. Then, I wrote and documented some functions required by the assignment and were used to work with the `penguins_mass.csv` and `penguins_cytb.fasta` files. Next, I implemented those functions to generate the `penguins_mass_cytb.csv` file as well as plot some graphs.
